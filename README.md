Milestone 02 - Employee REST API with DB2 (Servlet V2)

Overview
This milestone extends the Employee RESTful API by integrating the project with an IBM DB2 database.
It implements database connectivity using JDBC with JNDI connection pooling and supports saving an employee with their hobbies using a one-to-many relationship.
